/**
 * @title HookVaultV2
 * @dev A `VaultV2` with two governance-controlled additions. Both are off by default, so
 * a freshly deployed or upgraded vault behaves exactly like `VaultV2` until governance
 * turns one on.
 *
 * `compoundOnWithdraw`: run the strategy's hard work before pricing a withdrawal, so the
 * exiting user is credited the interest accrued since the last hard work rather than
 * leaving it to the remaining holders. `doHardWork()` also ends by depositing idle
 * underlying into the yield source, and the vault then redeems from that same yield
 * source a few lines later. Yield sources that forbid depositing and redeeming together
 * - a redemption delay, a withdrawal queue - reject that second call and the withdrawal
 * reverts. So the vault asks the strategy whether it implements {IHardWorkHooks}. If it
 * does, the withdrawal path calls `doHardWorkOnWithdraw()` instead, which credits the
 * same accrued interest without depositing. If it does not, the vault calls
 * `doHardWork()`.
 *
 * `depositCap`: a maximum total underlying the vault may hold, checked before any funds
 * move and reported through the ERC-4626 `maxDeposit`/`maxMint` views.
 *
 * The deposit path is otherwise untouched, and a deposit never runs a hard work.
 *
 * Storage layout and every other entrypoint are inherited from `VaultV2` unchanged; the
 * two settings live in dedicated hashed slots, so this is a drop-in implementation for
 * an existing vault proxy.
