// IPOR Fusion bdUSD (USDC) on Ethereum, through HookVaultV2 + GeneralERC4626Strategy.
//
// bdUSD charges an off-boarding fee on every redemption (0.20% at the pinned block). The
// strategy redeems by shares so that fee comes out of the withdrawing user's own payout and
// is never socialised across the other holders - the second test pins that down.
//
// On a fork nothing rebalances the PlasmaVault, so its cached market balances do not
// accrue with simulated time. The happy path therefore does not assert "farmer earns
// money"; it asserts the stronger, fork-proof property that a farmer going through the
// Harvest vault ends up with what a depositor going straight into the PlasmaVault gets,
// minus only Harvest's fee on any profit.
//
// Developed and tested at blockNumber 25933440
